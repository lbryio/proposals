# Proposals

This repo is for discussing large projects. Here's the process:

## 0. When in doubt, ping @grin

If you're blocked, have questions, or are unsure about how to proceed, message @grin on Slack.

## 1. Create an issue for the proposal

The issue description should contain the following items:

- Owner: who is in charge of moving the issue forward? include contact info (email, slack, discord, etc)
- Problem Statement: what problem will this proposal be solving? a good problem statement is the most important part of any proposal
- [User Stories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story#Common_templates)
- Proposed Solutions: this is not required (pointing out a serious problem without having a ready solution is welcomed), but as the proposal evolves, proposed solutions will be added to the description. Good solutions may include:
  - simple summary (non-technical)
  - solution description  (technical)
  - pros, cons, how cons might be mitigated
  - assumptions and risks
  - test cases
  - implementation

## 2. Announce proposal in #tech on Slack

Post a link to the proposal. Ask who is interested in working on it.

## 3. Announce next steps

What is the next thing that needs to happen for the proposal to move forward? Is it refining the problem statement? Suggesting solutions? Commenting on existing solutions? Making a decision? Designing the implementation? Testing? Releasing?

When is the next step due?

Who is responsible for the next step? Remember, the owner's job is not to do the whole thing themselves, but to ensure that the process moves forward.

## 4. Do the next step

## 5. Repeat until  done
